                                wrappers

This is a set of POSIX scripts that implement some handy wrappers for
various programs.  Each script has its respective manual page.

The scripts are the following.
• fm:       Wrapper around lf(1)
• img:      Wrapper around sxiv(1) to use thumbnail view.
• mus:      Wrapper around mpc(1) to select and play songs.
• scrot:    Wrapper around maim(1) to take screenshots.
• wm:       Wrapper around wmctrl(1) to manage the active window.


§ Installation

The following lists the dependencies each script has.
• fm:       lf(1).
• img:      sxiv(1).
• mus:      mpd(1), mpc(1).
• scrot:    mmutils(1), xdotool(1), maim(1).
• wm:       wmctrl(1)

First, edit ./config.mk to match your local setup.

Since these are just script, they do not need to be built.

By default, the scripts are installed into the /usr/local prefix.  Enter
the following command to install them (if necessary as root).  This
command installs the scripts into the ${PREFIX}/bin/ directory, and the
manual pages into the ${MANPREFIX}/man1/ directory.

	make install


§ Usage

fm(1) just loads a config file for lf(1).

img(1) opens a image with sxiv(1).  It then lists all files in the same
directory in a thumbnail view mode.  You can also use this script to
open a directory, in which case all the image files in it will be listed
in the thumbnail view mode.

mus(1) takes a command to select or display songs or playlists.  For
example, `mus next` plays the next song in the queue. `mus play` lists
the songs in the queue or play a given song. `mus playlist` lists the
playlists or load a given playlist.

scrot(1) takes a command to take screenshot.  `scrot monitor` takes a
screenshot of the monitor; `scrot window` takes a screenshot of the
window; and `scrot select` takes a screenshot of a selected area.

wm(1) control the active window.  `wm minimize` minimize the active
window.  `wm maximize` maximize the active window.  `wm close` close the
active window.  `wm move` move and resize the active window with slop(1).


§ License

Except for img(1) (which was copied from the ranger file manager), all
the scripts are in public domain.  All the scripts are provided AS IS,
with NO WARRANTY.
